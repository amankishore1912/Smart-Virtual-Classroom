The Smart Virtual Classroom (SVC) emerges as a pioneering initiative in the realm of educational technology, presenting a dynamic and inclusive approach to remote learning which endeavors to transcend traditional classroom boundaries by integrating cutting-edge technologies. At its core, the SVC is a fusion of video conferencing, real-time collaboration tools, and artificial intelligence, synergistically crafted to create an immersive and adaptive virtual learning environment.
